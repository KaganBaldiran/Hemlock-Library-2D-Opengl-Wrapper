# Hemlock-Library-2D-Opengl-Wrapper
Hemlock library is a project that I started to learn more about opengl and ended up creating this relatively small game/context library . It's still under development.

Consists of functions needed to render basic primitives , textures and fonts on the screen . Also along with that it also supports of collision box , collision checking and input handling.
